Python interface to Fritz by XYZBot

This repo is in anticipation of getting Fritz up and running using python as its programming interface using a Raspberry Pi connected to the Arduino that controls Fritz.

For more information on Fritz see XYZBot's website at http://xyzbot.com/ or its kickstarter at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1591853389/fritz-a-robotic-puppet/

Additional hardware and code that's to be added is a smart pixel by Adafruit behind the "eyeball" so that Fritz can change its eye color based upon mood.

A smart pixel is a chainable series of multicolor LEDs. See http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=adasearch&q=Smart+pixel
